                Born and raised in Uganda - East Africa, HUM KAY
                (aka Humphrey .M. Kiingi) is one of 6 siblings. Right
                from childhood, HUM KAY showed great interest in music as
                he and his siblings often performed the songs and rhymes
                he learnt from nursery school soon upon his return at
                home. His first and perhaps most unforgettable
                performance was before a church audience at the age of
                about 8. From that point on, HUM KAY'S musical talent
                could only move forward and upward.</p>

                <p>
                Because he spent the years that followed separated from family,
                however, his personal and later career growth was bound to be an
                uphill task for the most part. He had to survive on whatever little
                he could get from relatives and compassionate friends, because at the
                time food, clothing and other day to day utilities were often in very
                limited supply; barely enough to get by.</p>

                <p>
                In spite of the financial and personal struggles however, God was gracious in
                enabling HUM KAY to attain a decent formal education; completing his primary
                level from Victoria Nile School and his secondary level at Busoga College
                Mwiri, before joining Makerere University, where he graduated with honors and
                served as a part-time lecturer at the same university for the next 7 years.
                Thereafter, HUM KAY reverted to his music career and ministry.</p>

                <p>
                Currently, HUM KAY is an accomplished recording artiste and one of the leading
                vocal coaches in East Africa, he has coached renowned artistes including
                Maurice Kirya, Exodus, Solome and Rachel Magoola of the legendary Afrigo Band!</p>
