        <h4>Purpose Statement</h4>

        It is the intent of the school of worship (SOW) to transition the body
        of Christ from the place where worship leaders learn on the pulpit, to
        a place where both prospective and serving worship ministers can obtain
        focused Biblical Teaching, Professional Training and Hands-on
        Mentorship, so as to be equipped for the work of ministry.

        <h4>Vision</h4>

        Through the school of worship (SOW) we believe to see the emergence of
        a new breed of effective, balanced, mature, skillful and sociable
        worship ministers, who are spiritually aware of their call and place in
        ministry.

        <h4>Appeal</h4>

        <p>To make this much-needed school a reality I would like to appeal to you
        my friends, family and people of God to consider becoming covenant
        partners through regular (monthly, annual etc) financial support or
        simply by a one-time donation as you may feel moved to give towards
        this worship altar. It is my conviction that the time for worshipers
        learning on the pulpit must come to an end and a proper structure put
        in place to groom and disciple them put in place. Your support can make
        that possible.</p>
